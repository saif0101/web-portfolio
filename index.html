            <h3> Web-Developer</h3>
            <p>A web developer is a programmer who develops World Wide Web applications using a client–server model. The applications typically use HTML, CSS and JavaScript in the client, PHP, ASP.NET (C#), Python, Node.js, Go or Java in the server, and http for communications between client and server. A web developer may specialize in client-side applications (front-end developer), server-side applications (back-end developer), or both (full-stack developer).</p>

                In addition to mastering HTML and CSS, he/she also knows how to:
                
                Program a browser (like using JavaScript, jQuery, Angular, or Vue)
                Program a server (like using PHP, ASP, Python, or Node)

            <p>Front-end web development, also known as client-side development is the practice of producing HTML, CSS and JavaScript for a website or Web Application so that a user can see and interact with them directly. The challenge associated with front end development is that the tools and techniques used to create the front end of a website change constantly and so the developer needs to constantly be aware of how the field is developing.</p>
